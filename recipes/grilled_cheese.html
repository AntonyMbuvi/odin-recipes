    <h4>HOW TO COOK a Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h4>
    <p>Making a Grilled Cheese Sandwich can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h4>Grilled Cheese Sandwich Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</strong>: This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.

            Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese</strong>: This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</li>
        <li><strong>How to Make the Best Grilled Cheese</strong>: Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
            <ol>
                <li>Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a hot skillet.</li>
                <li>Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side up)</li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        
    </ul>
